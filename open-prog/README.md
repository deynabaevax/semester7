# Open Programme Deliverables
## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the final deliverables for my seventh semester. It is a comprehensive project that involves the development of a Streamlit application, which comprises of two distinct pages that host two separate applications. 

## The Projects
The first application is focused on text classification, which is the process of categorizing text into predefined categories or labels. The second application is centered on sentiment analysis, which is the process of determining the emotional tone or attitude of a given piece of text. 
Both applications are critical components of the overall project and are essential to its successful completion.
